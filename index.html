			It's late november, everybody knows what this means, madness is about to ensue. Some might say, their favorite season is neigh. Everyone stares at their calendar impatiently counting down the days for the clock to finally strike 12. Arguably one of the most unifying holidays is about to ensue. Its Spotify wrapped season. Since 2016 every Spotify user, even the non premium users, get this special treat of their own user analysis with funky designs and vague horoscopey user evaluations and every year people hurry to their social media to boast about their carefully curated music collection and without fail, every year I get embarrassed of my own wrapped. Aside from this being a very casual revelation as to how much data Spotify harvests, it also is a fun playing ground. Spotify has a huge user base, 551 million to be exact ( 220 million of those pay premium ) And every year there are a selected few artists that either gain or hold on to their popularity with those 551 million users. One of them is America's darling and favorite white women: <span>Taylor Swift </span>. 
			A powerhouse that is constantly breaking and releasing records. 
			<br>
			I am not aiming to find any winning pattern or secret recipe to her success. This might just come down to the classic combination of talent and luck (and a sizable dash of privilege). </p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>I am trying to find out if I should lend <span>Taylor </span> a spot on my spotify wrapped 2024…  </h2>
			<br>
			<p>
			<span>Taylor</span> has been releasing music since 2006. This adds to her statistical and real life success. She grew with her audience and repositioned herself within a wide array of different genres ( I am still waiting for a Taylor RnB era ). This is reflected with her placing in second while not even coming close to Ed Sheerans or The Weeknds equally inescapable songs “blinding lights” and “shape of you”. ( note: My data set is not recent, Taylor has made Number 1 as of 2023 ).

When I think of <span>Taylor Swift </span>three things come to mind: astronomical ticket prices, the Kanye incident and everything that came afterwards, and the christian fall girl aesthetic. So I tried to figure out if her music releases are also reflecting that hunch. ANND can I get a small round of applause: I am correct. Most of Taylor's songs get released during the fall —  in October, to be specific. Honestly, I am pretty proud of this proven assumption but to beat myself from my own high horse, this comes to no surprise to probably anyone who knows anything about her and her music. Two rather recent albums “Evermore” and “Folklore” look and sound straight out of an #cottagecore #darkacademia #christianfallgirl Tiktok. Still if you compare this to the music release trends from the rest of the music industry, October is a remarkably weird choice. The majority of the songs globally, get released either in January or in May. Taylor built herself this way another leeway to stand out. I like that, she knows her audience quite well.

			The thing is,<span> Taylor</span> never made it into my wrapped. She never even made it into a playlis. Yes I am indeed not like other girls ( I hope you get the reference ) , but I would like to be. She’s talented and apparently manages to produce banger after banger. So to avoid further possibilities of Fomo, I decided to pop some of my Taylor Swift cherries and listen to her top songs in the following categories: Energy, Valence and Danceability. Those seem important to me.

		This song sounds straight out of a puberty fueled rebellious “it’s just a phase” era. 
		Very alternative rock from the early 2005. My 15 year-old self would’ve probably enjoyed this song.

			I have no Idea what Spotify is doing with a high danceability rating for a song like this? 
It sounds more like Billie Eillish meets Lorde slow “dark” song.  Didn’t expect so much cursing when all I wanted was to dance.
